Django Banish Plus
====
**Django Banish Plus** is a Django *middleware* app to banish *user agents by IP address* or *User Agent Header*.
It also supports basic abuse prevention by automatically banning users if they **exceed a certain number of requests per minute**, which is likely some form of attack or attempted *denial of service*.

Django Banish Plus stores all ***banishments*** in memory to avoid database lookups on every request. 
It requires memcached, especially for the IP abuse monitoring feature.

Django Banish Plus is based on [Django Banish](http://github.com/yourabi/django-banish) package by [Yousef Ourabi][1].

Features
----------

1. Banish requests, by **IP** or **user agent header** included blacklist.
2. Avoid banish request by whitelist.
3. Banish request from TOR network, using TOR IPS database.
4. The banish action is configurable, (403 response, redirect or custom template).

Setup
------
Install django-banish. Make sure it is on your PYTHONPATH or in your django project directory.

In your django project settings.py you must set the following options:

1. Add ``'banish.middleware.BanishMiddleware'`` to ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``

2. Add ``'banish'`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS``

3. Run ``manage.py migrate`` to apply database changes and create new tables.

4. Add ``BANISH_ENABLED = True`` to enable Django-Banish (handy if you lock yourself out, you can just set this to False)
    
5. ``ADD BANISH_EMPTY_UA = True|False`` to specify wether requests without a USER_AGENT header will be banned.

6. Optionally set ``DEFAULT_BANISH_ABUSE_THRESHOLD`` (default is 100000) to the threshold of requests per minute

7. Optionally set ``BANISH_MESSAGE`` (default is "You are banned.") to change default message for banned user.

8. Optionally set ``BANISH_URL_REDIRECT`` to set url to redirect if request is banish.

9.  Optionally set ``BANISH_TEMPLATRE`` to render a custom template if request is banish.

10. Optionally set ``BANISH_RESTRICT_FILTER`` = True|False (default False), to specific url patch where banish is applied.

11. ``BANISH_ABUSE_THRESHOLD_TO_URL`` array whit dict "url path" and  "threshold"

12. Set ``BANISH_ONLY_WHITELIST = True|False``to allow only request from whitelist.

13. Set ``BANISH_TOR_IPS = True|False`` to banish TOR request.

14. Set ``TOR_IPS_DATABASE`` with tor ips database, (example, ``TOR_IPS_DATABASE = "http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/ip_list_exit.php/Tor_ip_list_EXIT.csv"``)

15. Set ``TOR_CACHE_KEY`` with cache key. (example ``TOR_CACHE_KEY = "tor-ip-exit-list"``)


Example
------

```

BANISH_ENABLED = False
BANISH_EMPTY_UA = True
BANISH_RESTRICT_FILTER = True

DEFAULT_BANISH_ABUSE_THRESHOLD = 10000
BANISH_ABUSE_THRESHOLD_TO_URL = [
	{u'url': u'/api/v1/',      u'threshold': 100},
	{u'url': u'/api/v2/', 	 u'threshold': 100},
	{u'url': u'/api/v3/', u'threshold': 10},
	{u'url': u'/api/v4/',     u'threshold': 5}
]

BANISH_TOR_IPS = True
BANISH_ONLY_WHITELIST = False

TOR_IPS_DATABASE = u"http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/ip_list_exit.php/Tor_ip_list_EXIT.csv"
TOR_CACHE_KEY = u"tor-ip-exit-list"
BANISH_MESSAGE = u"{'msg': 'Banish Access'}"
